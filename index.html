            hey. welcome to my little corner of the internet. im 100% experimenting with this website, no squarespace or weebly, but hand made from scratch by me. we'll see how it             goes. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            here are some ideas i have for headers:
            <br>
            - music: where i share music im listening to and why im fired up about it
            <br>
            - writing: where i write about shit im fired up about.
            <br>
            - art: where i post drawings and maybe write about them.
            <br>
            - shop: where i link you to redbubble because i don't have time to host my own store.
            <br>
            maybe i'll sell originals one day, but i haven't yet. we'll see. there probably needs to be some sort of contact page somewhere too. maybe i'll just put my email out               there and say "you can email me, that's cool" because it's 2020 and if you can't email by now then oof. i don't know what you'll think of my website, that's for sure.
