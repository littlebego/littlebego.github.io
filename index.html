            hey. my name is anthony and you're on my website. im 100% experimenting with this space. im going for retro meets open-source meets "fuck it, i'll host it on github because it's free." we'll see how it goes. is this brutalism or minimalism? no one will ever know. i'm getting away from social media in general because it's terrible for artists. and in general. welcome to the shit show.

            filler text. blah blah blah. lorem ipsum or whatever.

            there probably needs to be some sort of contact page somewhere too. maybe i'll just put my email out there and say "you can email me, that's cool" because i don't really like contact forms.
