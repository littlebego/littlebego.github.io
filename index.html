        <h2> welcome to my little corner of the internet. </h2>
        <p>
            hey. my name is anthony and you're on my website. im 100% experimenting with this space, so im going for retro meets open-source meets "fuck it, i'll host it on github because i can save some money." we'll see how it goes. is this brutalism or minimalism? no one will ever know. i'm trying to get away from social media in general because it's terrible for artists. and in general.

            here are some ideas i have for headers:
            <br>
            <br>
            - music: where i share music im listening to and why im fired up about it
            <br>
            - writing: where i write about shit im fired up about.
            <br>
            - art: where i post drawings and maybe write about them.
            <br>
            - shop: where i link you to redbubble because i don't have time to host my own store.
            <br>
            <br>
            maybe i'll sell originals one day, but i haven't yet. we'll see.
        </p>

            there probably needs to be some sort of contact page somewhere too. maybe i'll just put my email out there and say "you can email me, that's cool" because i don't really like contact forms.
