            hey. my name is anthony and you're on my website. im 100% experimenting with this space, so im going for retro meets open-source meets "fuck it, host it on github because you can save that cheddar." we'll see how it goes. is this brutalism or minimalism? no one will ever know. by the way i will curse. probably too much. buckle up.

            here are some ideas i have for headers:
            <br>
            <br>
            - music: where i share music im listening to and why im fired up about it
            <br>
            - writing: where i write about shit im fired up about.
            <br>
            - art: where i post drawings and maybe write about them.
            <br>
            - shop: where i link you to redbubble because i don't have time to host my own store.
            <br>
            <br>
            maybe i'll sell originals one day, but i haven't yet. we'll see. 
            <hr>
            there probably needs to be some sort of contact page somewhere too. maybe i'll just put my email out there and say "you can email me, that's cool" because it's 2020 and if you can't email by now then oof. i don't know what you'll think of my website, that's for sure.
